<h4><b><u><font color="blue">MCA</font></u></b> stands for <b><u><font color="blue">Master od Computer Application</font></u></b></h4>

<p>Master of Computer Application provides intensive preparation in the concepts and techniques related to the design, programming and application of computer system. It was established in the year 2009..Students are provided with a deeper understanding of both fundamentals and important current issues in Computer Science so that they may either obtain lucrative employment or can pursue higher studies.</p>

<h4><b><font color="red">STRUCTURE OF THE CURRICULUM</font></b></h4>
There are two streams in computer education. One of them is the Engineering stream leading to the B.E./B.Tech degree and the other an application stream leading to the MCA degree. In the B.E./ B.Tech course the primary emphasis is on designing computer hardware and systems software. The primary emphasis in MCA on the other hand, is on designing information systems for various organizations such as banks, insurance companies, hotels, hospitals etc. Development of application software in diverse areas where computers are used will be the main function of MCA graduates. Thus in the MCA curriculum hardware, system software and embedded system design are not emphasized. The major thrust is on giving the students a sound background in computing, business functioning and mathematics relevant to information technology. Thus the curriculum has these three streams of courses each semester running concurrently. In computing, students learn best by doing. A strong laboratory component is a part of the curriculum. The laboratories, besides supplementing the theory course should also expose the student to the use of the latest software tools. Every MCA student is required to spend one semester in an industry developing a software system.</p>
